# GotPass

a safe home for your passwords.

GotPass is my very first and serious python project I have created so far. Its soul purpose is to provide an easy way for you to get to your precious information with near impossible room for decryption. It provides a simple, easy to use, keyboard based terminal. Why create a word file full of passwords when anyone can open it up and steal your information? Or better yet, delete your password word file with the rest of your tens and hundreds of word files on your desktop. This is the one safe home for your passwords.

The .zip file will contain the .exe application if you want to download it for yourself and use it.

The .py file contains the source code if you want to edit or request to add something here that I need.
